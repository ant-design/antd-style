## Introduction

For general styling needs, basic requirements can be met through [createStyles](/usage/create-styles), while `createStylish` is considered an advanced usage.

In a complex business system, there may be some common styles with finer granularity that are not enough to form a component. However, repeatedly writing these styles is not only time-consuming but also results in a lot of duplicate code. Moreover, if a designer requests a unified adjustment of the design style, the cost of making multiple modifications is extremely high. To address this issue, `createStylish` was developed.

`createStylish` can create reusable styles. In concept, it is similar to the popular tailwindcss in recent years, but it is more flexible and practical. When combined with Ant Design V5 Token System, it can achieve a highly efficient and flexible user experience.
